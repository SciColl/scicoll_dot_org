                                Eileen was SciColl's program manager for the duration of the project. She was responsible for the day-to-day operations of SciColl, working directly with the chair of the Executive Board to ensure that SciColl priorities established by the Board were implemented. Eileen also served on the U.S. Interagency Working Group for Scientific Collections (IWGSC), which was responsible for similar initiatives to SciColl at the U.S. Federal level.

In that role she was in charge of managing a large collection of samples associated with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and damage assessment. That position required both a cross-disciplinary approach to processing and data acquisition, and the maintenance of samples held under litigation-appropriate chain-of-custody procedures.
