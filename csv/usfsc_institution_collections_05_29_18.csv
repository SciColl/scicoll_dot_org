IADN determines the loadings of toxic contaminants to the Great Lakes, tracks the effectiveness of toxic reduction efforts, and identifies sources for additional reduction efforts.  Through a cooperative agreement with Indiana University, IADN collects air and precipitation samples at five sites along the shores of the Great Lakes. Air and particle samples are collected for 24 hours every 12 days.  Precipitation samples are integrated over a month.  Every sample is extracted, concentrated, cleaned up and fractionated, and then analyzed for a broad suite of toxic contaminants using gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry.  There are two types of samples archived at Indiana University. The first is a residual of each processed sample.  There are about 4 archived vials (4ml and 2ml) per sample depending on the solvent fractionation and analytical methods applied.  The archived extracts are routinely monitored for solvent loss and topped off when necessary.  The 4 ml vials are generally kept for a minimum of 5 years (current archive dates back to 2006) while the 2 ml vials date back to 2005.  The second type of archived sample is raw subsamples from a high volume air samplers at Chicago and Cleveland sampling sites consisting of approximately 25 grams of XAD resin.  Raw samples date back to about 2003.

The collection of pecan cultivars was maintained as grafted trees (or as limbs in trees) in orchards at Brownwood, Texas. The collection was designated as the National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Pecans and Hickories in 1984, and a Crop Germplasm Committee (CGC) was formed. Additional collections were recommended by the CGC to represent native pecan populations throughout the range (the Provenance Collection), and to represent other Carya species (the Hickory Species Collection).  	  	There are currently over 300 pecan cultivars being maintained in the Cultivar Collection, with many more being present as nut specimens only. These cultivars represent all pecan growing regions of the United States. This is the largest and most rigorous collection of pecan cultivars in the world. Accessions are maintained as grafted trees, targeting two trees of each cultivar at the Brownwood site, with duplicate collections at the College Station site. Accessions are provided upon request to researchers, and are provided to private growers when commercial nurserymen can not provide wood of a cultivar. Accessions are distributed as graftwood (typically 5 double graft sticks per accession) in January and February. In addition, seed is occasionally distributed from particular accessions for establishment of seedling rootstocks for subsequent grafting. Nut voucher specimens are maintained for each tree to verify identification. In addition nut samples of many cultivars are represented by collections from other orchards. Complete historical passport information on pecan cultivars (Thompson and Young, 1985) and hickory cultivars (Grauke, 1988) has been published. Verified inventories of most pecan cultivars have been characterized with isozyme analysis (Marquard et al., 1994) to provide a method of biochemical verification. The commercial pecan nursery industry needs improved methods of cultivar identification and verification. It is imperative that future biochemical characterizations of cultivars be based on verified accessions. Errors of characterization in the literature, based on incorrectly identified samples from other sources, have been corrected when compared to analyses of verified accessions from this collection.

Small tubers are typical of wild potato species, but they represent a veritable treasure chest of genetic diversity for potentially useful traits that may someday be bred into new varieties. These new varieties must be able to overcome the challenges of pests and stresses with less dependence on chemical fertilizers, insecticides and fungicides. NRSP-6 is doing this through a 5-fold approach: Acquisition, Classification, Preservation, Evaluation and Distribution of potato germplasm.   ARS scientists at the Potato Introduction Station maintain a collection of true seeds, in-vitro stocks, and tubers of wild and cultivated potato (Solanum, section Petota). The collection includes 5,932 germplasm accessions of 92 species of the potato and 14,270 herbarium sheets. The collection has about 75 percent of the wild species and is actively incorporating more. Resources are used by a variety of scientific disciplines from physiology to entomology to taxonomy, but its primary use is by potato breeders to incorporate resistances to diseases and pests that affect the cultivated potato crop, and for agronomic improvements in appearance, flavor, and yield. The genebank takes a five-fold approach of introduction, classification, preservation, evaluation, and distribution of potato germplasm. In addition, duplicate herbarium specimens can be loaned to recognized institutions and scientists upon request. This collection is part of the US National Plant Germplasm System.

The station was established in 1952 with the initial mission to acquire new plant germplasm and establish a maintenance program. Subsequently, germplasm conservation and research programs developed in the disciplines of horticulture, agronomy, genetics, plant pathology, and entomology. Primary facilities are located on the campus of Washington State University, and sister programs include the National Temperate Forage Legume Genetic Resources Unit in Prosser, Washington, and the National Arid Land Plant Genetic Resources Unit in Parlier, California. Recently, WRPIS has been involved in preserving collections of special genetic stocks and developing core subsets of the larger collections.  	   Sub-collections include:     	  		Medicago truncatula Germplasm Collection:    The first NPGS M. truncatula accession was received in 1950, when a commercial strain and 9 unimproved samples were received from J.R.A. McMillan from the University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Currently, the collection includes 387 available ecotypes of M. truncatula, originating from 22 countries. Over 50% of the accessions were collected in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. A collaborative collection effort was carried out in 1973 in Morocco by I. Forbes, of the United States Department of Agriculture and J.S. Gladstones of the Australian Department of Agriculture. W. Graves, of the University of California also made extensive contributions from collections in Morocco and Tunisia in the early 1980s. Approximately 55% of the collection was received in the late 1980&rsquo;s, when the NPGS inherited the germplasm collection of the late Canadian taxonomist, Dr. Karl A. Lesins. Most of the accessions (80% of collection total) in the M. truncatula collection are unimproved or wild germplasm. Another 15-20% of the collection is either cultivars or breeding materials. A large portion of the cultivated germplasm has been obtained from ex situ germplasm collection in Australia. The collection is being strategically and actively expanded to include important genetic stocks that are being developed by the genomics community. To find additional information regarding the accessions in the M. truncatula collection the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN-Global) database can be queried.       	  		Pisum Genetic Stock Collection:    This collection of genetic stocks of Pisum sativum is the legacy of the late Dr. Gerald A. Marx, formerly of Cornell University. Throughout his career, Dr. Marx amassed some 80,000 seed packets, most of which have genotype data and other comments written on them. Shortly before his death, Dr. Marx contracted with the United States Department of Agriculture to preserve a subset of his holdings in perpetuity, as a special collection in the National Plant Germplasm System. Dr. Marx, along with several other pea geneticists, extracted the accessions of his collection that best demonstrate mutations in this species, and the interaction of these mutations.  	  	This collection is now maintained at the Western Regional Plant Introduction Station, located on the campus of Washington State University, in Pullman, Washington. The accessions are regenerated, evaluated, and stored at the Pullman station, and are freely available for distribution to anyone with a bona fide research, development, or educational interest.  	  	Over one hundred defined mutations are represented in this collection, in a set of approximately five hundred accessions. While the great majority of these accessions are the direct product of Dr. Marx&#39; program, new accessions from others are welcome additions to this collection if they represent new mutations, or genotypes with combinations of genes that are of particular interest.       	  		Phaseolus Germplasm Collection : Secondary contact - Ted Kisha, tkisha@wsu.edu; Phone: 509-335-6898         	  		Safflower Genetic Resources    Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is an ancient crop with many uses. Traditionally it was grown for its flowers, which are used as a dye, for food coloring, flavoring, and for medicinal purposes. Seeds are now the major use, producing bird feed and a high quality edible and industrial oil. Potential, expanded uses include production of transgenic pharmaceuticals, as a biofuel, and for specialty oil types to improve human diet.  	  	The Western Regional Plant Introduction Station (WRPIS) at Pullman maintains the USDA national collection of safflower germplasm, which currently includes more than 2300 accessions. These accessions, representing germplasm from more than 50 countries, are available without charge to scientists upon request.       	  		National Temperate Forage Legume Genetic Resources Unit    The USDA National Plant Germplasm System&rsquo;s temperate forage legume germplasm is managed by a team of scientists, technicians and support personnel of the Western Regional Plant Introduction Station in Pullman, WA. Germplasm seed is stored and distributed from the station&rsquo;s home on Washington State University (WSU)&rsquo;s main campus in Pullman, WA. All regeneration, characterization and evaluation efforts are carried out at the worksite in Prosser, WA, collocated with WSU&rsquo;s Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center. The project&rsquo;s mission is to develop a conservation program to help reduce the shrinking reservoir of biodiversity in forage legumes, crops such as alfalfa and clover that are important feed for livestock, particularly dairy animals.  	  	Guided by the principles of conservation genetics, day-to-day activities focus on acquiring, maintaining, characterizing, evaluating, documenting and distributing a wide range of diverse germplasm. Diversity in the collections include crop wild relatives closely related to alfalfa, clover and trefoil to primitive farmer and heirloom varieties as well as more modern varieties obtained from around the world.

It is devoted to the cryogenic banking of marine environmental specimens (e.g., fish tissues, mussels, oysters, marine mammal tissues, bird eggs and feathers, sea turtle tissues and eggs, coral tissues and coral ecosystem specimens) as part of ongoing research and monitoring programs conducted in the marine and coastal environment of the USA, including Alaska and the Pacific Islands Region. In addition, the Marine ESB houses all samples (e.g., human livers, marine sediments, fish tissues, mussels, oysters, human diet samples) that were maintained at the former NIST National Biomonitoring Specimen Bank (NBSB) which was established in 1979. The Marine ESB is specifically designed to cryogenically store these environmental specimens over long periods of time (50-100 years). A systematic well-designed specimen bank program is not only a valuable component of realtime monitoring and basic research, but it also enables future investigators to extend their research into the past (hind casting) and provides for future verification of analytical results (quality assurance). The Marine ESB is an important resource of research materials that are used to document geographic and temporal trends in &ldquo;new&rdquo; pollutants, changes in transport and accumulation of &ldquo;old&rdquo; pollutants in the environment that might be related to climate change, and to study temporal changes in marine animal health through application of future new analytical and biochemical techniques. Additionally, samples are not limited to just pollution research but have also been used to determine cellular and biomolecular measurements, RNA analysis for genetics and evolutionary studies, as well as food web studies through stable isotope and fatty acid analysis.  Standardized protocols are developed by NIST for collecting and archiving tissues and fluids which are designed to: (1) provide sufficient material for multiple analyses, (2) minimize the possibility of sample change and/or loss during storage, (3) minimize inadvertent contamination during sample handling and ensure sample integrity, (4) provide for long-term sample stability through cryogenic techniques, and (5) track and maintain a record of sample history.","Biological: Animal-derived (skins, eggs, feathers, etc.)","Storage Environment: Frozen (-132 - -196)","Yes","331 Ft Johnson Road","Hollings Marine Laboratory",,"Charleston","SC","29412","USA",,,,,,,,"24711","Yes",
