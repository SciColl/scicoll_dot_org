The entomology collection (international collection coden: KNWR) currently includes over 7,000 databased specimens/lots, mostly insects collected as part of the Refuge&rsquo;s Long Term Ecological Monitoring Program.  The herbarium contains over 200 plant specimens, including many older specimens from the 1950s and 1960s.  Our collection data are managed on Arctos and are searchable via an entomology collection portal, an herbarium portal, and through GBIF.  Genetic data (DNA barcodes) from KNWR specimens are posted on BOLD and GenBank.  Loans of KNWR specimens for research purposes are encouraged.  Since most KNWR arthropod specimens are eventually to be deposited at the University of Alaska Museum, please refer to the UAM entomology collection loan policy for general loan guidelines.    The arthropod collection contains about 20,000 specimens focused on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. All of the arthropods (insects, spiders, centipedes, etc.) will be a single collection without the need for collection codes for the foreseeable future. There are also a handful of Gastropods and Oligochaetes included.","P.O. Box 2139","MS 519",,"Soldotna","Alaska","99669","USA","1 Ski Hill Road",,,"Soldotna","Alaska","99669","USA",,,"2800",,,,,

It belongs to the U. S. National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian Institution) and has been housed at Georgia Southern University since 1990. The collection contains specimens from all continents, most of the approximately 860 known species of ticks, and a quarter of the primary tick types.  Ticks (Ixodida) are haematophagous mites (Acari). During their blood meal, ticks can acquire and/or transmit a number of microorganisms, some of which can cause diseases in humans, domestic and wild animals. Because of the impact of ticks on human and veterinary medicine, the USNTC is not only a significant resource of material and information for tick taxonomists but also for public health officials.","Institute for Coastal Plain Science","75 Georgia Avenue, Building 204","PO BOX 8056","Statesboro","GA","30460-8056","USA",,,,,,,"USA",,,"25418",,,,,

The requests will be assessed by Curation staff to determine if the request can be met with the collections curated at the AHC, to determine appropriateness of the request, and if destructive analysis is proposed, the request must be approved by the Research Committee of CANM/AHC.              Once collections access is assessed and approved AHC Curation staff will arrange a specific time when the collections can be made available.  As much advance notice as possible is respectfully requested.  Thirty days lead time is preferred from the time the request is made, until access to collections is provided.   Collections/Archives Access for NAGPRA collections              Due to the sensitive nature and legal requirements of collections that fall under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (43 CFR Part 10), any requests for access to information, documentation or collections that include NAGPRA material must first receive approval from AHC Research Committee and agency or bureau that owns, and therefore has legal control of the requested collections and information before access can be granted.","27501 Highway 184",,,"Dolores","CO","81323","USA",,,,,,,,,,"24305",,,,,

The Database Management Unit (DBMU) develops and operates the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN).

First, farm and land management technologies that reduce erosion and nutrient losses, conserve soil, and protect ecological resources will be assessed. Second, studies will be conducted to improve understanding of structure, function, and key processes of aquatic systems, guiding better management of these systems and providing a scientific basis for regulatory agencies to establish water quality criteria. Third, investigations will develop and assess technology for improving water quality and ecosystem function in agriculturally impacted aquatic systems. Fourth, investigations will assemble and use long-term databases to develop and further enhance computer models for quantifying effects of conservation measures on agricultural watershed ecosystem services. Experiments will be conducted across a range of spatial scales in laboratories and facilities at the USDA-ARS, National Sedimentation Laboratory in Oxford, MS, on regional, state, and Federal experiment stations, and on private farms and watersheds.

Emphasis is on the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) that collects, conserves, documents, evaluates, enhances, and distributes plant genetic resources used by U.S. and world agriculture. Three units and four projects in NGRL support the NPGS. The Database Management Unit (DBMU) develops and operates the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN). This database maintains electronic information on more than 570,000 unique accessions at twenty NPGS locations. Genebank staff use GRIN to manage the collections. Detailed information about NPGS accessions is also displayed in a public website that includes the capability for scientists to request material. DBMU also provides similar, but less comprehensive, support for ARS insect, microbial and animal germplasm programs by hosting online access to their databases. The Plant Exchange Office (PEO) arranges domestic and foreign plant explorations and exchanges that increase the quantity and quality of NPGS holdings. They help identify gaps in collections and support options for both ex situ and in situ conservation of crop plants and their progenitors. PEO is also responsible for GRIN-Taxonomy, widely regarded as the international standard for the nomenclature of agriculturally important plants. PEO arranges for required agricultural inspection of many NPGS distributions to foreign countries. The Plant Disease Research Unit (PDRU) conducts greenhouse and laboratory research on obligate parasite plant pathogens of quarantine significance. PDRU scientists study the biology of quarantine diseases and develop improved methods to detect and eliminate quarantine pathogens, primarily from clonally propagated plant germplasm. This directly benefits both the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the NPGS by facilitating the safe international movement of plant germplasm.","USDA/ARS, National Germplasm Resources Laboratory","Bldg. 003, Rm. 102, BARC-WEST","10300 Baltimore Ave.","Beltsville","Maryland","20705","USA",,,,,,,,,,"25112",,,,,

Much orf our work focusses on marine and coastal geology and oceanography, but we partner with researchers and collabroators in other fields. PCMSC is part of the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP - https://marine.usgs.gov/about.html). As a program CMGP works with many and varied partners to ensure that our Nation has the information it needs to understand, restore and protect healthy coastal and ocean resources and the communities who depend on them.  More than half of our Nation&#39;s population lives within 50 miles of the coast, along productive estuaries and extensive coastlines of the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and the Caribbean Sea. Healthy coastal and offshore resources are vital to our nation&#39;s economy through energy, commerce and shipping, fisheries, tourism and recreation. We rely on new technologies, scientific data and analysis to support the wise use and protection of these resources and also inform policies and decisions that prepare us for extreme events, natural hazards, and climate change.  Coastal and marine geology expertise contributes to the greater USGS mission of providing impartial information on the health of our ecosystems and environment, the natural hazards that threaten us, the natural resources we rely on, the impacts of climate and land-use change, and the core science systems that help us provide timely, relevant, and usable information.  The major CMGP Science Centers are located in Woods Hole, Massachusetts; Santa Cruz and Menlo Park, California; and St. Petersburg, Florida. Administrative offices are in Reston, Virginia.
