The Collection has considerable material from Pacific deep sea (&gt;1,000 m) locations, including the Tonga and Mariana Trenches.   The Collection supports scientific research by providing specimens for study on the taxonomy, evolution, and ecology of benthic invertebrates. Specimens are available for examination at Scripps and for loan to researchers at recognized institutions worldwide, consistent with our loan policies. The Collection serves as a long-term repository for specimens, including material properly preserved for genomic studies. Collection materials are also used to support graduate and undergraduate courses and research, as well as educational outreach programs at the Birch Aquarium at Scripps.","Biological: Animal-derived (skins, eggs, feathers, etc.)","Sample Treatment: Dried","Yes","9500 Gilman Drive #0244",,,"La Jolla","California","92093-0244","USA","Scripps Institution of Oceonography","University of California, San Diego 0244","9500 Gilman Drive","La Jolla","California","92093-0244","USA","25579","Yes",

The MSB Division of Amphibians and Reptiles maintains nearly 100,000 specimens, mostly from the Southwestern United States (primarily from New Mexico and surrounding states). The collection also includes substantial numbers of specimens from elsewhere in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean region, the Galapagos Islands, and Vietnam. The division maintains representative skeletal material, a small type collection, and a collection of uncatalogued specimens for teaching purposes. Important collections in the division&rsquo;s holdings are from Big Bend National Park by W.G. Degenhardt and T.L. Brown (all taxa), the Appalachian Plateau by G.B. Wilmott (salamanders), the West Indies by K.L. Jones (leptodactylid frogs), and the Delmarva Peninsula by R. Conant (all taxa). A collection of 5,000 amphibians and reptiles made by William J. Koster formed the basis of the original collection; however,a dramatic increase in holdings occurred with the arrival of William G. Degenhardt in 1960 from Texas A&amp;M University. Through Degenhardt&rsquo;s own collecting efforts and those of his students, the division grew rapidly in size during the 1960&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. Since the late 1980&rsquo;s, the division has become the primary repository for specimens collected as part of expanding research on the State&rsquo;s herpetofauna by the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, and continues to receive collections provided by researchers from a variety of state and federal agencies. These extensive collections and the increased knowledge of New Mexico&rsquo;s herpetofauna has resulted in the publication of Amphibians and Reptiles of New Mexico (1996) by W.G. Degenhardt, C.W.

The Division of Mammals contains over 250,000 catalogued specimens and is among the 5 largest in the world. Specimens date back to the 1890&#39;s with the majority documenting the rapid environmental change that has occurred since 1950. The collections are taxonomically broad, representing 27 orders, 103 families, 513 genera, ~1,400 species. The majority from the Orders Rodentia (190,000), Chiroptera (25,000), Carnivora (15,000), Soricomorpha (10,000) and Artiodactyla (7,500). The collections are world-wide in scope (72 countries and all 50 US states) with particularly strong holdings from Western North America (150,000 specimens), Beringia and high latitudes (26,000 from Alaska, Russia and Canada), Mongolia (4,200 specimens and parasites), and Latin America (10,200 specimens from Bolivia 7,000 from Chile; 5,000 from Panama). The collection contains 16 holotypes, 6 paratypes, 1 syntype, 93 symbiotypes. Important collections integrated into the MSB include the USGS Biological Surveys collection (26,000), the UIMNH (Hoffmeister) Collection (33,000), Rausch Collection (4,000 specimens and parasites). Specimens range from traditional skin/skull and fluid vouchers to &quot;holistic vouchers&quot; containing skin, skull, post-cranial skeleton, up to seven tissue types (heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, muscle, blood), cell suspensions, and ecto and endo parasites. Additionally, frozen tissue samples are available for about 130,000 individual mammals and date back to the late 1970&#39;s. 37,000 specimens have serology data associated with hantavirus surveillance programs in the Americas. The MSB houses an extensive archive of field journals and catalogues that date to the 1900&#39;s and are associated with specimens held in the collection. The collections are growing rapidly through the active research programs of curators, staff and students and ongoing collaborations with other institutions and governmental agencies.","Biological: Other or Undefined","Storage Environment: Ambient controlled (indoors)","Yes","Museum of Southwestern Biology","University of New Mexico",,"Albuquerque","New Mexico","87131-0001","USA","302 Yale Blvd NE","CERIA 83, Room 204",,"Albuquerque","New Mexico","87131-0001","USA","2571","Yes",

The first catalogue ledger of the Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection was started in 1941.  The first 879 entries were transcribed from index cards and include specimens collected as far back as 1870.  Most of these early specimens do not include collector information.  The earliest specimen with collector information is an Eastern Massasauga collected by Stephen A. Forbes in Pekin, Illinois in 1873.  Also among these earliest records with collector data are specimens from Colorado collected by George Cooper and C.C. Crandall in 1875.  Other early collectors include F.S. Earle (specimens collected in Union Co., IL; 1877); Harrison Garman (Marshall Co., IL; 1878); H.A. Surface (Mason Co., IL; 1882) and Julius Hurter (Madison Co., IL; 1896).  	  	Holdings. The Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection contains approximately 24,000 catalogued specimens, representing 55 families and over 550 species (51% Amphibia, 49% Reptilia). The geographical emphasis is Illinois (75%). This is the result of the efforts of Phil W. Smith, who collected specimens from 1935 to 1949 for his comprehensive study &quot;The Amphibians and Reptiles of Illinois,&quot; published in 1961. In addition to the Illinois material, the INHS collection also houses specimens from 45 other U.S. states, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Most notable among these are specimens collected by P.W. Smith from California (1943-1952) and Mexico (1957-1965), specimens of S.A. Minton from Pakistan, Mexico and Texas and specimens from Thailand collected by R.W. Larimore (1963).  	  	Frozen Tissues. We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998.

The representation of Minnesota&#39;s flora is unparalleled, with over 170,000 specimens collected throughout Minnesota&rsquo;s history by E. Nielson, O. Lakela, J.W. Moore, W.R. Smith, and many others. The assemblage of historic flora of the Upper Midwest, including the Dakotas, Wisconsin, and southwestern Ontario, is among the best in the U.S. There is an excellent collection of circumboreal and arctic flora due to past research interests of E.C. Abbe, W.S. Cooper, D. Lawrence, and their students. Additionally there is an excellent collection of historic Pacific island flora, through the efforts of J. Tilden, A.A. Heller, and J.W. Moore, as well as a collection of early Amazonian flora by H.H. Rusby and R. Squires as part of the early exploration (1895-1896) of the Orinoco River delta by the Oronoco Company Limited of Minnesota. J.W. Congdon&#39;s collection (over 9,000 specimens) of early California plants (including Yosemite National Park) and approximately 3500 specimens of western US and early tropical Asian flora acquired through J.H. Sandberg&#39;s exchanges are other significant collections.  This section also houses a small collection of paleobotanical specimens spanning the geologic time scale (155 macrofossils and about 75 thin sections).  The fungal collection consists of approximately 100,000 non-lichenized fungi specimens and almost 150,000 specimens of lichenized fungi.  Intensive scientific investigation of Minnesota non-lichenized fungi occurred from about 1885 to 1910, supported by the Geological and Natural History Survey of Minnesota. Collections made between 1910 and 1960 focused primarily on plant disease fungi. Renewed interest in documenting fleshy fungi began in the 1960s and has expanded in recent years with increased emphasis on the analysis of biodiversity. The following were important collectors who contributed: E.W.D. Holway (rusts of North and South America), M.E. Palm (Minnesota slime molds and fleshy fungi), M.G. Weaver, and D.J. McLaughlin and his students (Minnesota fleshy fungi). There is also an extensive collection of plant pathogenic fungi, especially the Minnesota collections of E.M. Freeman, L.T. Dosdall, and others, and rusts deposited by the U.S.D.A. Cereal Disease Laboratory (St. Paul, MN).  There are also excellent collections of lichenized fungi from the Sonoran Desert region, Minnesota, and national parks and forests (primarily by Clifford Wetmore).  The lichenized fungi also include Bruce Fink&#39;s Minnesota lichens, G. Llano&#39;s collections, and S.K. Harris&#39; New England lichens along with a good representation of the European lichen flora.  Birds and mammals currently comprise over 45,000 birds and 20,000 mammals. In addition to Minnesota vertebrates the Museum also has important holdings of birds and mammals of the Philippines and Borneo (Menage Expedition, 1890-1893) and Mexico (Dickerman and Warner expeditions of the 1960s and 1970s), birds of Peru and Bolivia, and small mammals of the Yucatan &amp; Patagonia (Birney expeditions of the 1970s and 1990s, respectively).  The fish collection currently contains over 45,000 cataloged lots, containing representatives of 142 families, 480 genera, and 1046 species, the majority of which are stored in ethyl alcohol. There is one primary and seven secondary types, including paratypes of the rare Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). The collection dates from the end of the 19th century and contains specimens collected by Ulysses Cox, Henry Nachtrieb, Thaddeus Surber, Samuel Eddy, James Underhill and others. These individuals, their students, and colleagues were responsible for building the collections from the 1890&#39;s to the present. Early collections focused on fishes of the upper Midwest, especially Minnesota. However, significant historical collections include specimens from the Menage expedition to the Philippines in the 1890&#39;s; specimens from Hawaii collected by E.K Jordan in the early 1900&#39;s; and many specimens from the continental United States. Many of the taxa represented in these earlier collections are now rare or endangered. Samuel Eddy, James Underhill, Andrew Simons, and their colleagues and students were responsible for most of the growth of the collections since the 1950&#39;s. The focus of their collections was also on Minnesota and surrounding states, although recent collecting has increased holdings of North American freshwater fishes from the southeastern highlands of the United States. Current accessions include continuing surveys in Minnesota (50%) and the eastern United States (50%). The fish collection also contains diverse holdings of marine fishes from the Pacific Northwest, Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic coast. In addition to the alcoholic collection there is a large collection of pharyngeal teeth from cyprinids (carps and minnows) and catostomids (suckers), a large uncataloged larval fish collection, and a growing collection of dry and cleared-and-stained skeletal material.  The reptile and amphibian collection contains approximately 19,000 specimens and focuses on the upper Midwest. This collection also contains significant collections from Mexico (Regal collections), the southeastern United States, as well as smaller collections from South Pacific islands and southwestern United States. The collection includes representative of 40 families, 152 genera, and 360 species. Among the accessioned material is an extensive series of leopard frogs collected by David Merrell in the 1960s. Merrell&#39;s frogs established a baseline for studying the history of frog malformations in the Upper Midwest. The collection also contains an impressive series of cleared and stained specimens from these studies that were deposited by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.   The invertebrate collection comprises 18,000 lots of mollusks, snails, and crayfish. There is also a small collection of marine specimens that was donated by the Minneapolis Public Library. Recently, the U.S. National Park Service has also begun surveying national park properties within the state and is providing the Museum with its crayfish vouchers. In addition to invertebrates, there is also a small fossil collection (approximately 1000 vertebrate fossils), mainly from Minnesota and Idaho, collected by Robert Bright (Dept. of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior) and his students in the 1970s.","Biological: Other or Undefined","Sample Treatment: Dried","Yes","1987 Upper Buford Circle",,,"St. Paul","Minnesota","55108","USA",,,,,,,,"2828","Yes",

The herbarium has important collections from Norway, Iceland, the Arctic (especially Greenland, Jan Mayen, Bear Island, Svalbard, and Novaya Zemlya), Macaronesia, and East Africa (especially Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda). The material includes, e.g., the collections of Mathias Numsen Blytt (1789-1862), S&oslash;ren Christian Sommerfelt (1794-1838), Niels Green Moe (1812-1892), Johannes Mus&aelig;us Norman (1823-1903; part), Bernt Lynge (1884-1942), Eilif Dahl (1916-1993), and Hildur Krog (1922-).  Computerization of the herbarium labels started in September 1994, and by September 2010, all Norwegian and c. 30,000 foreign specimens are recorded. Priority is given to specimens sent out on loan, type material, and Arctic and African material. The database runs on PC&#39;s under DOS, and the data are made available through GBIF-Norway to the data portal at GBIF, Artskart and NLD.  Type material may also the queried through a special service.  To facilitate registration of floristic data, the herbarium runs a field note database (NXL) and a field inventory database. These services are in Norwegian, and the databases use UTM-coordinates (MGRS notation) for localization. On these pages, you may generate registration forms for use in the field, send completed forms to the databases, and perform simple queries. The data are regularily transferred to the three portals mentioned above.  We are happy to present the bibliography databases Recent Literature on Lichens (RLL, covering the period 1951 &ndash; today) and Mattick&#39;s Literature Index (1532 &ndash; 1950) in co-operation with its authors. The databases can be reached through a common search form.  The site also runs the web page for the International Association for Lichenologist&#39;s field meeting in Yunnan, 2002, and the abstract database of the 7th International Mycological Congress, Oslo, 2002.

Tuomey in the mid 1800s and were used extensively for teaching purposes.  Most of the collection was presumably lost during the Civil War when federal troops destroyed the University of Alabama campus.  Only a few of Tuomey&rsquo;s original &ldquo;cabinet&rdquo; specimens survive in the collections of the Alabama Museum of Natural History and the Geological Survey of Alabama.  	  	In the 1870s, as professor and state geologist, Eugene Allen Smith, directed students on field trips throughout the state where they collected many new specimens and met persons who also contributed to the collections.  	  	Dr. Dana Ehret is Curator of Paleontology.  	  	The Invertebrate Paleontology Collection is estimated to contain over 20,000 lots of specimens, although only 4,000 are catalogued. Specimens are mainly from the Oligocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous deposits of Alabama. The Paleogene (Eocene plus Oligocene) deposits in Alabama are considered to be among the best in the world.  The Vertebrate Paleontology Collection consists of over 8,000 catalogued items, most of which consist of individual specimens. The collection contains items from the Pennsylvanian, Cretaceous and Paleogene deposits of Alabama, but focuses primarily on Cretaceous and Eocene marine formations. The vertebrate collections have strong representation of Cretaceous mosasaurs, Eocene whales, and Pennsylvanian trackways from the Union Chapel Mine trackway site.  The Paleobotany Collection consists of over 400 specimens catalogued, mostly from the Pennsylvanian and Cretaceous of Alabama, as well as petrified wood from Arizona.","Paleontological: Invertebrate Body Fossils","Storage Environment: Ambient controlled (indoors)","Yes","The University of Alabama Museums","357 Mary Harmon Bryant Hall","Box 870340","Tuscaloosa","Alabama","35487","USA",,,,,,,,,"Yes",

Eggs in this collection range in size from the tiny eggs of hummingbirds (0.2 grams) to the gigantic eggs of the extinct elephant bird (9 kilograms). Approximately 80-90% of the specimens are accompanied by original collector data slips and by photographs of sets taken in the museum, both of which are digitally linked to the record online.

Fossil collecting began in 1895 with the sponsorship of Mr. Andrew Carnegie, who supported the museum&rsquo;s numerous early expeditions to the American West that resulted in one of the best dinosaur collections in the world. Carnegie in his retirement further strengthened the collection with the purchase in 1903 of a large collection of Paleozoic-Cenozoic, European fossils from the Baron de Bayet, a private fossil collector from Brussels, Belgium. Strengths of the collection include Mississippian fishes from Bear Gulch, Montana; Pennsylvanian and Permian fishes, amphibians and reptiles from Pennsylvania, Ohio,  West Virginia and the southwestern United States; Jurassic dinosaurs, especially sauropods, from Utah (Dinosaur National Monument) and Wyoming; Jurassic fishes and reptiles from Germany and France; Eocene fishes from Monte Bolca, Italy; Eocene and Oligocene tetrapods, from Montana, Wyoming and Utah; Miocene mammals from a site now preserved as Agate Springs Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska; and Pleistocene vertebrates from the Appalachian region.","Paleontological: Trace Fossils",,"Yes","Carnegie Museum of Natural History","Section of Vertebrate Paleontology","4400 Forbes Avenue","Pittsburgh","PA","15213","USA",,,,,,,,"24462","Yes",

This was followed by a period of inactivity until the arrival of Ernest Pilsbury Walker as an undergraduate. He collected specimens around the southeastern part of the state from 1910 through 1912. He also contributed his personal collection from Sheridan, Indiana. Beyond sporadic trading and salvaging, the collection has been mostly inactive for the past 100 years until Matt Carling was hired as curator and James Maley was hired as collections manager.

This includes more than 733 combined species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish. Many of the samples have voucher specimens that are housed in the Sam Noble Museum. There is a strong representation of mammals from Argentina and Oklahoma, plus amphibians, reptiles and birds from the Great Plains.","Biological: Cells, tissue (non-human)","Sample Treatment: Cryopreserved","Yes","University of Oklahoma","2401 Chautauqua Ave.",,"Norman","OK","73072","USA",,,,,,,,"23721","Yes","71e82020-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a"

The renowned Iguanodons from Bernissart, ambassadors of the Belgian science institute in Brussels, represent a natural history collection currently estimated to hold over 37 million specimens. The roots of the present day collection reach far back in history. It evolved from the Natural History collection of Karel of Lotharingen, governor of The Netherlands (1712-1780) and was part of didactic materials owned by the Central School of the City of Brussels. After the independence of Belgium, the City of Brussels donated the collection to the Belgian Government and became part of the autonomous Royal Natural History Museum in 1846, known as the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences since 1948. Fieldwork by researchers and collaborators, in Belgium and abroad, donations and purchases have been expanding the assets ever since. Data presented here are coming from the darwin database, the collection management tool of the RBINS. Today, the darwin database manages information on about 350.000 specimens stored in the institute&#39;s depositories. This number rises on a daily basis thanks to the continued efforts of curators and their adjuncts that are responsible for maintaining the stored specimens and information. Our online database provides information about the collections of the Vertebrates, Invertebrates, Entomology and Paleobotany. The application will soon be expanded with paleontozoological data. The Department of Geology and the Department of Marine Ecosystems provide information on different systems. More information on these departments can be found on www.sciencesnaturelles.be/institute/structure/geology/gsb_website and www.mumm.ac.be The corner stone of the darwin database is the specimen and the information about its origin and its status. Although the status of the specimens sollow the current regulations of the International Code on Zoological Nomenclature other status specifications not treated by the ICZN regulations (eg. topotype) have been maintained as supplementary information about the specimen(s) in question.","Biological: Animal-derived (skins, eggs, feathers, etc.)","Sample Treatment: Dried","Yes","patrick.semal@naturalsciences.be","collections@naturalsciences.be",,"Bruxelles",,"1000","Belgium",,,,,,,,"25502","Yes",

It is an amalgamation of private donations, collections originally in other institutions, and material collected by the Museum. The Curator is assisted in collection chores by 1.5 part-time Collection Associates and about seven Curatorial Assistants (volunteers). BMSM consists mostly of Recent mollusks, with a focus on the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and the Caribbean. There are circa 2,500 fluid-preserved lots. Fossils represent only 5.5% of the total number of lots. Digitization of the collection started in 1997, through a MS Access-based platform. By the time of the Museum&rsquo;s first accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) (March 2010), only 27,000 lots (out of an originally estimated 120,000) had been catalogued. On that occasion, one of the &ldquo;Areas of Improvement by Next Review&rdquo; recommended by AAM&rsquo;s Accreditation Commission was that the Museum should take action to &ldquo;... further improve the documentation of collections.&rdquo; This process started in October 2012 with the inception of the first of two &ldquo;Museums for America &ndash; Collections Stewardship&rdquo; grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The catalogue resides in a dedicated server, and is backed-up daily both in-house and through a commercial service (Mozy Pro).  In 2011, BMSM incorporated about 11,000 lots from the local Florida Gulf Coast University. The decision by the FGCU administration to move the collection to the Shell Museum shows the degree of trust placed in the organization. The 10,000-lots Redfern Collection, donated in 2014, includes material illustrated in Colin Redfern&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bahamian Seashells&rdquo; books. The regional relevance of the collection is substantiated by circa 7,500 lots of marine mollusks from Sanibel and Captiva islands and neighboring areas. BMSM includes 18 primary types and 211 secondary types. Collection workers are assisted by a 4,000+ volume specialized library, high-resolution photographic equipment with digital stacking software, and other relevant tools and equipment.  Metadata are available from the Shell Museum web site at http://shellmuseum.emc2webs.com/collection/ (right) and iDigBio/Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, left) at http://ipt.idigbio.org/resource?r=bmnsm-shell. About 9,200 lots are georeferenced . The resource has been registered with GBIF, and is itself registered in GBIF as a data publisher endorsed by U.S. Geological Survey. The online identification guide &ldquo;SW Shells with Emphasis on Sanibel &amp; Captiva&rdquo;, currently covering 355 species, is based on the BMSM Collection.","Biological: Cells, tissue (non-human)","Sample Treatment: Dried","Yes","3075 Sanibel-Captiva Road",,,"Sanibel","Florida","33957","USA",,,,,,,,"25335","Yes",

Early collecting efforts focused on increasing holdings of Coleoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera, while the current research strengths of the WIRC include Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera. This diversity reflects the ongoing research of curatorial and support staff as well as taxonomic graduate training and several key collection donations.

The collection grew steadily over the years with the work of A.W. Slocom, S. K. Roy, E. S. Richardson and other Field Museum geologists plus numerous donations from other museums, universities, and the general public. In 1965 the Field Museum acquired the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Walker Museum fossil invertebrates, which more than doubled the total number of specimens in the collection. Today there are an estimated 2 million specimens divided into ~320,000 specimen lots. The majority of the collection is arranged systematically divided by geologic periods.

MSB fish records, available on FishNet2, include all holdings except for fishes collected on private and Tribal lands. MSB fish specimens consist of mostly cypriniform larval and adult fishes (vouchers and tissues), conserved, across taxa, in 5% buffered formalin, 70% and 95% ethanol, and frozen at -20&deg;C and -80&deg;C to maintain good examples for morphological, osteological, and genetic research. The MSB Division of Fishes does not hold holotypes and divides collections of paratypes with other permanent fish collections. Over 60,000 pages of field books and field data forms are archived in the Division. These documents are digitally captured and electronically archived in tiff files (permanent) and clean PDF files for viewing.
