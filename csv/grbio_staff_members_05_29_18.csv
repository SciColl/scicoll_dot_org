We are making great strides to bring the collection up to modern standards by databasing and reorganizing the collection, curating the specimens, and upgrading the facilities.    However, my primary interests rest with questions pertaining to the evolution and maintenance of orchid diversity. This journey has lead to a series of papers on the relationship between orchids and euglossine bees, the evolution and mechanisms of deception pollination, specificity in orchid-mycorrhizal associations, genetic structure of orchid populations, taxonomy of Caribbean orchids, the biogeography of the West Indies and Orchidaceae, land use history and the local distribution of native specie, and most recently the ecology of naturalized orchids. We are currently studying the reproductive biology and population dynamics of invasive, non-native orchids such as Oeceoclades maculata, Dendrobium crumenatum, Arundina graminifolia and Spathoglottis plicata, and how they may affect populations of native species. In addition, we have begun a study the invasion biology of non-native pines in Puerto Rico and pollination networks in tropical beach dune systems.    The issues I address span taxonomy, evolution, ecology, conservation, and environmental science which means that virtually none of my work has been done without the collaborative efforts of my undergraduate and graduate students, and colleagues within the UPR system and elsewhere.    Although my passion is directed towards the biology of orchids, I encourage my students to work on systems that create passion in their hearts. Some have studied orchids, but others have worked on quite different model systems including Bignoniaceae, Bromeliaceae, Cactaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Myrsinaceae, Pinaceae, Zamiaceae, karst vegetation, plant viruses, rust diseases, invasive species biology and floral fragrances, all asking a variety of ecological and evolutionary questions employing a marvelous array of approaches and tools.","1950","Department of Biology","University of Puerto Rico","PO Box 23360","San Juan","Puerto Rico","00931","Puerto Rico","787) 764-0000 ext. 2023, 2900, 2901, 7558","(787) 764-3875","ackerman.upr@gmail.com","15127","UPRRP","24059","UPRRP Herbarium"

A significant portion (i.e., hundreds-of-thousands) of the materials curated are done so on behalf of and in collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Interior, specifically its National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The collection includes extensive holdings from both natural history and archeological contexts.    Established in 1937, the LTRR is an interdisciplinary department at the University of Arizona. The LTRR's long-standing international renown derives from extensive contributions to research, teaching, and public service in dendrochronology, a field founded in the early 20th century by LTRR's first director, A.E. Douglass. “Dendrochronologists” study tree rings as natural chronometers and as recorders of change in the environment with which all biological life and human cultures are inescapably linked. Tree rings are especially valuable for yielding absolute, single-year dates for past events and processes and provide a pre-industrial perspective on cultures and environment that is otherwise unattainable.",,"1215 E.

Main playground for biodiscovery is the North-eastern Atlantic and especially the Irish waters from the seashore until the deep sea, through collaborations with local marine biologists and ecologists, we work in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas or the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  Expertise in the purification by HPLC and structure elucidation by NMR and MS of all types of specialized metabolites. Such natural products may find applications in the pharmaceutical, the cosmetical or agri-food sectors. Through the establishment of a National Marine Biodiscovery Laboratory in Ireland we strive for a strong collaboration between marine biologists, taxonomists, microbiologists, and chemists to organize a biological and chemical repository of marine products",,"olivier.thomas@nuigalway.ie","Marine Biodiscovery, Chemistry, room C212","School of Chemistry, NUI Galway University Road","Galway",,,"Ireland",,,"olivier.thomas@nuigalway.ie",,,,"National University Of Ireland, Galway"
