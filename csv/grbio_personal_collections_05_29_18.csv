To know which is going where, contact us at djanzen@sas.upenn.edu and whallwac@sas.upenn.edu.   Primary specimen recipients are American Museum of Natural History, Monell Cryofacility (New York, N.

Specimens are either oven dried (pinned, spread, mounted) in the field in ACG in Costa Rica, or preserved in 95% ETOH and refrigerated or frozen (-20C) until later processing and deposition in an institutional collection.    Caterpillars and wild-caught adult Lepidoptera are individually voucher coded with a voucher code of the kind yy-SRNP-x to yy-SRNP-xxxxx if reared, or yy-SRNP-xxxxxx if wild-caught.  If parasites reared from a SRNP voucher, the parasite receives also its own individual voucher code of the format DHJPARxxxxxxx (though if it was a lot reared from one caterpillar, only the individuals selected from that lot for individual treatment receive the DHJPARxxxxxxx individual code.  It is hoped that the SRNP and DHJPAR acronyms will not be used by other collections to distinguish their voucher codes from others.","Biological: Other or Undefined","Storage Environment: Other (please define)","Department of Biology","University of Pennsylvania","3740 Hamilton Walk","Philadelphia","PA","19104-6018","USA","Department of Biology","University of Pennsylvania","3740 Hamilton Walk","Philadelphia","PA","19104-6018","USA","2644","Yes",

In an innovative approach, barcodes of aerial  insectivorous bats, an important but often undersampled component of local bat assemblages, are  collected together with species‐specific reference calls that function as acoustic vouchers for these  species. To obtain reference calls, captured and identified aerial insectivorous bats are recorded with  specialized bat detectors upon release. Representative echolocation calls can only be recorded when  bats are flying freely in an open area. This procedure prohibits the collection of a conventional museum  specimen but also provides the basis for non‐invasive acoustic studies that are rapidly becoming more  common and widespread. A barcoding approach, however, allows collecting an essential and  complementary genetic voucher for the animals. Knowledge of Neotropical bat flies is limited, thus this  barcoding study is expected to alleviate taxonomic uncertainty within this group and add substantial  new information on diversity and ecology (e.g. host specificity) of these parasites. As bat flies can spread  pathogens between individuals, our approach will also provide essential basic information for disease  ecology in bats.  *** These vouchers are currently at STRI ***",,,"Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute","Apartado 0843-03092",,"Balboa","Ancón","Apartado 0843-03092","Panama",,,,,,,,"25660","Yes",
